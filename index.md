Hi! I’m Aris — though, disappointingly, not named after Aristotle. I’m an undergraduate senior studying Psychology and Data Analytics at Boston College, and I’m currently applying to graduate programs in Cognitive Science, HCI, and Computational Media. 

This website aims to add a splash of color to the typically sterile nature of a resume. Here, I plan to share projects, blog posts, photos, and other enjoyable aspects of my life alongside an overview of my professional journey. 

Fret not! If you’re looking for a strictly professional glimpse into my background, you can find it here: [resume](resume.pdf).

My research interests focus on humanity's interaction with the external environment, particularly at the intersection of technology, human behavior, and the psyche. I believe this triangular interaction is the key driver of our cognitive and biological evolution and will continue to shape our future. As we become increasingly integrated with technology, I find it crucial to study how we engage with our manufactured environment more closely.
